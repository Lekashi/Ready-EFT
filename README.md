## Description
This project is made to speed up the time out of raid with giving the user a helpful checklist. After the user finishes the checklist the user will be prompted that his/her character is ready to go into a raid. Feature to soon come is the group mode where you can pair up with friends and are able to see the ready status of the users teammates. The goup host would be able to set up a timer count down to make his teammates get into raid on time.
